# **Next Steps: Deep Learning**

- After completing the foundational concepts in Python, data analysis, and backend development, my next focus will be on mastering Deep Learning.
- This will include learning about neural networks, deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow and PyTorch), and real-world applications such as image classification, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
- I will be adding projects and resources related to these topics as I progress.
