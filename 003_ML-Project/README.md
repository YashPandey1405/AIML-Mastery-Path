## 🔗 [Sensor-Fault-Detection-ML](https://github.com/YashPandey1405/Sensor-Fault-Detection-ML)

This repository contains an **end-to-end Machine Learning project** focused on **fault detection in semiconductor wafers** using data from **59 sensors**. The model classifies each wafer as **Good (+1)** or **Bad (-1)** based on sensor readings. The project represents a **real-world industrial application** of ML and is part of my AIML journey.

### 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Complete ML Pipeline: Ingestion → Preprocessing → Training → Evaluation → Inference
- 📊 Sensor data-based classification with 59 numerical features
- 🧠 Models used: Random Forest, SVM, and other classifiers
- 🗂️ Modular code with clear structure for scalability
- 📁 Organized Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and experimentation
- 🔐 Model persistence and prediction pipeline
- 🧼 Data validation and cleaning logic

### ☁️ Planned AWS Deployment

This project will be **deployed on AWS**, with the following architecture in mind:

- **AWS EC2** – Hosting the model prediction API (Flask or FastAPI)
- **AWS S3** – Storage for trained models and datasets
- **AWS API Gateway / Lambda (optional)** – For serverless and scalable access

> Stay tuned for the deployed version and API link in upcoming updates!
