**My Journey Through Python, Machine Learning, and Future Deep Learning**

Welcome to my journey of mastering **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**! This repository links all the languages and projects I've worked on, starting from **Python fundamentals**, progressing through **Machine Learning** techniques, and with **Deep Learning** coming up next.

## ðŸ“‚ Repositories in My Journey

### 1. [**Python-PlayGround**](https://github.com/YashPandey1405/Python-Playground)

With **38+ commits**, this repository showcases my Python journey, including foundational concepts, data structures, and algorithms. It also includes practical statistics implementations to reinforce my understanding of data science principles.

### 2. [**ML-Fundamentals**](https://github.com/YashPandey1405/ML-Fundamentals)

With **25+ commits**, this repository highlights my exploration of **Machine Learning** concepts. It contains Jupyter Notebook implementations of various ML algorithms, such as regression, classification, and clustering.

### 3. **Deep Learning (Coming Soon)**

Next on my path is **Deep Learning**. I plan to delve into artificial neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and more. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue this journey.

## ðŸ“š Handwritten Notes

For those interested in more in-depth learning, I have also compiled my **handwritten notes** on **Statistics** and **Machine Learning**, available through the link below:
